RebuildMap.py
In this algorithm we aim to reconstruct a set of points in a 2D space based on a distance matrix.
As there are several ways to embed points in a an space given their distances, this algorithm can
guarantee a deterministic and exact method to project the points in a 2D space.
Even though, the orientation and direction of the space may change, the distances between the points
will remain the same, so the main goal is achieved.

The distances must be euclidean.
The format needed for the distance is a square symetric matrix, or at least a superior triangular matrix,
where the first diagonal must be all 0s, and the rest of the matrix must be distances between the points.

We permit to see the result generated in a plot.
Also it is possible to generate random points, and then reconstruct them. For that it is needed to set
matrix parameter as None.
In this case we can force to maintain the orientation of the points, so the first three points are
always (0,0), (4,0), and (3,2).
Also, if we generate random points, we can set the number of points to generate with n_points parameter.

There is an explanation of how to use the algorithm in the UseExample.py file.
